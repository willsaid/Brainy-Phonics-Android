Si(ng) a so(ng) of sixpence, a pocket full of rye,
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie.
When the pie was opened the birds began to si(ng),
Now wasnâ€™t this a dainty dish to set before the ki(ng)?

The ki(ng) was in the parlor counti(ng) out his money;
The queen was in the kitchen eati(ng) bread and honey;
The maid was in the garden ha(ng)i(ng) out the clothes,
And alo(ng) came a blackbird and nipped off her nose.
