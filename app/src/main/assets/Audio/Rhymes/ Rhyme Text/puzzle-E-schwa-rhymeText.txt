The el(e)phant want(e)d to cheat on her di(e)t
Found one gold(e)n cookie in the warm ov(e)n,
One in the gard(e)n, two in a torn pock(e)t,
Three hid in the kitch(e)n, that made sev(e)n,
Bought two at the mark(e)t, spied one in a bask(e)t,
Plus one she kept froz(e)n, that was elev(e)n,
And one from her lock(e)t, made twelve, a full doz(e)n
When she started to eat them it felt like pure heav(e)n!
